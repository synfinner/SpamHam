# SpamHam

This script is designed to send random emails to spam campaign urls that take in emails. 

For example, `baddomain[.]com/targetemail@himom[.]com`

Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Usage: `./spamham.py http://spamurl[.]ru/email`

## SOCKS5 Support

This script will route stuff through a SOCKS proxy running on 9150 ;). May need to change the port depending on how you're running the proxy. 

## Before you go

This script is for educational and trolling purposes only. Don't run this on things you don't own, else you'll get CFAA'd. I'm not responsible for your stupidity.

Have a cup of coffee for me, eh? 

Thanks,
